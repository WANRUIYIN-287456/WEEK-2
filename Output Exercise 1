Ring... Ring...
It's already 8.00am. I quickly prepare myself before attending the lessons today.
Today is Wednesday and my first class is programming.
This class is interesting as I can learn coding and have hands-on activities.
After this, I will be attending class for Mathematics for Information Technology. 
Next, I will be having lesson on Statistics for Information Technology.
 
All of these lessons that I will be learning today need exercise on it so that I can understand more thoroughly about the topics taught.
Hence, after lunch, I will start revising statistics first and do some exercise at 4-5pm.
Next, I will start revising maths at 5-6pm.
After having dinner, I will revise my programming language and do exercise on coding methods at 8-10pm.
Lastly, I will have some recreational activities in my leisure time to unwind after studying fot the whole day.
Thank you.
